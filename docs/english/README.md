> Some students reported that the list is more content, and once they can't finish reading, after a while, they can't remember the reading progress. In order to facilitate reading by everyone, I created a page with a checkbox in front of each article (checkbox is checked to read) to record the articles you have read so that you can continue reading when you come back next time. Page link: [Frontend Tech List] (https://alienzhou.github.io/frontend-tech-list/)

# Front-end technology list

The knowledge of learning articles is often fragmented. The front-end involves a wide range of aspects, and if this knowledge is not effectively combed, it cannot be connected in series to form a system. Therefore, I will abstract some front-end basic capabilities in combination with the work experience, and sort out some good articles I have read and written to form a list of (pure) front-end technologies.

Whether you are self-learning front-end or familiar with some of the front-end technologies but some are not yet involved, I hope this list will help you review some of the front-end basic capabilities.

## 2. Engineering and tools

> The expansion of software scale has brought about engineering needs, and the front end is no exception. With the advent of NodeJS, front-end engineers can use the familiar JS to quickly develop the tools they need. The prosperity of the tool chain ecology is also a portrayal of the prosperity of the front-end circle.

## 3. Performance optimization

> Performance optimization is actually "adapting to local conditions" based on the understanding of the browser, so it can be understood in conjunction with Section 1.3 "Browser".

It’s highly recommended to read through the articles in the [Performance Optimization on Google Web] (https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/why-performance-matters/) tab, which is basically covered in modern browsers. All points of performance optimization, very systematic. The following is also an excerpt from some of the personally considered very good lengths.
